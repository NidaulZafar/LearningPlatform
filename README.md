## About the Project
I designed and built this web app to practice my coding skills utilizing the knowledge of React and Laravel.
The web version of this project can be seen [here](https://learning-management-a43483664054.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage
The app provides a platform where instructors and students can come together to enjoy a learning environment
* First of all, users can sign up as an instructor or student.
* Instructors can add and browse courses and modules while students can enroll in them.
* Other features and functions include feedbacks, announcements and contact options.

Foreseeable errors like location access denied, failing to fetch data and unavailable data are handled such that the user can see on the screen what went wrong.


### Built With

The app was built using fullstack knowledge in React and Laravel:

## Roadmap

This is a basic app that fulfills the requirements for the MVP of a learning platform. Nevertheless, I intend to keep improving upon it with the following roadmap. 

- [x] Responsive app
- [x] User authentication
- [x] Storing the data in the Database
- [x] Use axios to fetch data from the database
- [x] Loading/error handling for the interaction with the API
- [x] Creating courses by the instructors and enrollment by the students
- [x] Feedback on the app
- [x] Contact Form
- [ ] Additional Options
    - [ ] Comments on the modules
    - [ ] Generate certificates on completion
